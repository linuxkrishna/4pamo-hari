 *              Shared memory address base for the NotifyShmDrv driver. This
 *              must be the start of shared memory as used by both connected
 *              processors, and the same must be specified on both sides when
 *              initializing the NotifyShmDrv driver.
 *  field  shmSize
 *              Size of shared memory provided to the NotifyShmDrv driver. This

 *  field  num_events
 *              Number of events required to be supported. Must be greater than
 *              or equal to reserved events supported by the driver.
 *  field  send_event_pollcount
 *              Poll count to be used when sending event. If the count is
 *              specified as -1, the wait will be infinite. NOTIFY_sendEvent
 *              will return with timeout error if the poll count expires before
 *              the other processor acknowledges the received event.
